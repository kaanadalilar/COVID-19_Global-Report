# COVID-19_Global-Report
Data Science Project to analyze COVID-19 pandemic
Project Description
In this project, we worked on a Kaggle dataset consisting of the cumulative count of confirmed, death, and recovered cases of COVID-19 from different countries starting from 22nd January, 2020. We analyzed the data both visually and statistically, as well as investigated any possible hidden relationship to make future predictions for a given geographical region. 

We also extracted features from additional datasets and combine them with the original one to perform data aggregation.

Our project is consisting of 3 main sections:
Exploratory Data Analysis

Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

Machine Learning
